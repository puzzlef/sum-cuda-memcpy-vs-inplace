Comparing various launch configs for CUDA based vector element sum.

A floating-point vector `x`, with no. of **elements** `1E+6` to `1E+9` was
summed up using CUDA (`Î£x`). Each no. of elements was attempted with
various **CUDA launch configs**, running each config 5 times to get a good
time measure. Sum here represents any reduction operation that processes
several values to a single value. Using a `grid_limit` of **1024** and a
`block_size` of **128** could be a decent choice. This sum uses *memcpy*
to transfer partial results to CPU, where the final sum is calculated. If
the result can be used within GPU itself, it might be faster to calculate
complete sum [in-place] instead of transferring to CPU.

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets].
