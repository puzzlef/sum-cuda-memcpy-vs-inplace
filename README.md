Performance of [memcpy] vs [in-place] based CUDA based **vector element sum**.

A floating-point vector `x`, with no. of **elements** `1E+6` to `1E+9` was
summed up using CUDA (`Î£x`). Each no. of elements was attempted with both
approaches, running each approach 5 times to get a good time measure. Sum
here represents any reduction operation that processes several values to a
single value. It appears **both approaches** have **similar** performance.

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. This
experiment was done with guidance from [Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee] and
[Prof. Kishore Kothapalli].
